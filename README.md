## Introduction
## Data Review and Cleanup for Visualization
 - Categorize customers into age ranges.
 - Analyzing purchase behavior and categorizing customers into classes/types based on their purchase count.
 - Identifying popular product categories, age distribution, gender distribution, and return rate.

## Visualization and Findings
1. **Trend Forecast and Historical Monthly Trend by Category**
The trend forecast model shows an overall upward trajectory in purchasing behavior over time, with fluctuations within quarterly periods possibly influenced by seasonal trends, marketing campaigns, or economic conditions. Specifically, the Books category exhibits a moderately significant upward trend (P-value = 0.35) throughout the year, while the Clothing category remains relatively constant (P-value = 0.46). The Electronics category shows a moderately significant downward trend (P-value = 0.15), and the Home category displays a moderately significant upward trend (P-value = 0.36) from January to December.

2. **Purchase Differences by Age and Category**
Purchase differences by age and category reveal that older males (65+) dominate book purchases, while females generally spend slightly more across all age groups. Clothing purchases show slight variation by gender, with increased spending in older age groups. Electronics purchases indicate slightly lower spending by females, with higher expenditures in older age groups for both genders. Significant home category purchases occur among both genders aged 45-54, and females aged 35-44 show a notable increase in spending.

3. **Customer Loyalty vs Purchasing Power**
Bronze customers representing 51.33% of purchases, targeting efforts towards this group, particularly those in the 25-34 age range, could significantly enhance upselling opportunities, revenue, and customer loyalty.

4. **Return Rate & Category Breakdown**
The overall return rate across all categories is 6%. Clothing items have the highest return rate, while books have a slightly lower return rate than clothing items, but they remain relatively high. And electronics have the lowest return rate among the analyzed product categories.
